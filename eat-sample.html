    <h1>The Big Apple's Big Eats</h1>

    <p>New York has, as you might expect of the Big Apple, all the eating options covered and you can find almost every
        type of food available and every cuisine of the world represented. There are tens of thousands of restaurants to
        suit all tastes and budgets, ranging from dingy $0.99-a-slice pizza joints to $500-a-plate prix fixe sushi and
        exclusive Michelin-starred eateries. Thousands of delis, bodegas, and grocery stores dot every corner of the
        city and DIY meals are easy and cheap to find. Street food comes in various tastes, ranging from the ubiquitous
        New York hot dog vendors to the many carts with Greek cuisine on street corners in mid-town. However in Midtown
        be wary of restaurants and bars both immediately on and around Times Square, within the Theater District or near
        the Empire State Building - many are tourist traps cashing in on travelers' gullibility and lack of local
        knowledge. New Yorkers wouldn't dream of eating out in such places; you shouldn't either! It pays to be
        adventurous therefore and reach out into the individual neighborhoods for a true authentic NYC dining
        experience. Even within Midtown, going a couple of blocks away in any direction from a major tourist street can
        make all the difference. Instead of eating on Times Square for example, venture two blocks to the west onto 9th
        Avenue to find a plethora of much more reasonably priced eating and drinking options.</p>

    <p>One "must do" while in New York City is a slice of New York style pizza and buy gyros. Whether it's your first
        time to New York, or you are a seasoned New York visitor, getting a "slice of pie" is a tradition every visitor
        should make time for! But before you do, it might be fun to learn the history of New York pizza and why it's so
        famous.</p>

    <p>Fruit stalls appear at many intersections from Spring to Fall with ready to eat strawberries, bananas, apples,
        etc available at very low cost. Vegetarians will find New York to be a paradise with hundreds of vegetarian-only
        restaurants and good veggie options in even the most expensive places.</p>

    <h2>Delis & Street Food</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The New York Bagel. There is no bagel like the New York Bagel anywhere else in the world. Bagels, which are
            a doughnut-shaped round of boiled dough with a distinctive, chewy, sweet interior and a leathery outer
            crust, arrived from the old world with Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and have become utterly New
            York in character. You can get bagels anywhere in the city but, for the best bagels you may have to trek
            away from the main tourist sites. Many bagel connoisseurs consider Absolute Bagels at Broadway and 107th
            street to be the most traditional and best. Ess-a-Bagel on 21st and 1st Av. and 3rd Av. between 51st and
            52nd Sts. also has a strong following. Many of the better bagel bakeries can be found in Brooklyn: one good
            spot is the Bagel Hole (see Prospect Park (7th Avenue of the F or G) or try looking in Midwood (Avenue J on
            the Q subway line). For the best bagels, go early when they are warm and straight from the oven. (Note that
            the famous H&H Bagels, featured in TV shows like "Seinfeld", went out of business in 2012, and its
            well-known Upper West Side location is now a cell phone store. A chain with a similar name, owned by one of
            the founders of the original, H&H Midtown Bagels East now operates several locations on the Upper East and
            Upper West Sides.)</li>
        <li>The Bialy. There's also a little-known cousin to the bagel, the bialy, which is like a bagel but the hole
            does not go all the way through, and topped with lightly caramelized onions. Kossar's Bialys on Grand Street
            at Essex is an ancient Lower East Side institution.</li>
        <li>The New York Hot Dog. Vendors all over the city sell hot dogs - affectionately called "dirty water dogs" by
            the locals - from pushcarts on city sidewalks and in parks. Choose your toppings from mustard, ketchup, and
            relish (or just ask for everything), wrap the dog in a paper napkin, and walk along the sidewalk trying not
            to let the toppings slip and slide all over your hands. Also recommended is Papaya King (several
            locations),[66] known for their inexpensive meals ($3.25 for a dog and a drink) and their blended tropical
            fruit drinks and smoothies. Or, take the Subway to Coney Island (D, F, N, Q trains, Coney Island - Stillwell
            Ave. stop) for the famous Nathan's hot dog (1310 Surf Ave).</li>
        <li>The New York Deli Sandwich. Another delicacy brought over by Jewish Immigrants, you must try either a corned
            beef or pastrami sandwich (a "Reuben" is always a good choice). There are some better known delis in the
            city, but the most famous one is Katz's Deli at Houston and Ludlow Streets. They have been around since
            1888, and still pack them in day and night.</li>
        <li>New York Pizza. A peculiarly New York thing, you can buy pizza, with a variety of toppings, by the slice
            from almost every pizzeria in the city. A New York pizza has a thin crust (sometimes chewy, sometimes
            crisp), plenty of cheese, and an artery-hardening sheen of grease on top. Buy a slice, fold in half
            lengthwise, and enjoy. If you just want a piece of plain cheese pizza, ask for "a slice." Or pick up one
            with pepperoni â€“ the quintessential meal on the go in New York.</li>
        <li>The New York Cheesecake. Made famous by Lindy's and Junior's deli in New York, it relies upon heavy cream,
            cream cheese, eggs and egg yolks to add a richness and a smooth consistency. Now available throughout the
            city, but to get the original, go to Junior's, just off the Manhattan Bridge in Downtown Brooklyn (see
            Downtown Brooklyn) (B, Q, or R to DeKalb Ave)</li>
        <li>The New York Egg Cream. Also often referred to as a "Chocolate Egg Cream". A blend of chocolate syrup, milk,
            and seltzer water. One of the best is found at Katz's Delicatessen. Though not often on the menu at many
            diners, if you ask for one they will still prepare it for you at most locations.</li>
        <li>The New York Greek Gyro. You can find Greek gyro vendors scattered throughout the city. However, a quick
            stop into the famous Mamoun's locations will get you one of the best classic doner sandwich in the city (St.
            Mark's Place and MacDougal St). Don't forget to try out their hot sauce and to bring cash! [67] If you're in
            the Upper East Side and looking for a gyro that has recognizable meat, check out Amali Restaurant on E60th
            between Lex and Park St, primarily a fine dining Mediterranean restaurant, the restaurant has an outdoor
            grill where they make chicken and pork doner with organic meat from Upstate New York and even stuff some
            tasty fries into their sandwich.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Restaurants</h2>
    <p>Maybe it's the size of New Yorkers' tiny kitchens, or perhaps it's the enormous melting-pot immigrant
        populations, but either way, this city excels at every kind of restaurant. There are fancy famous-chef
        restaurants, all ethnic cuisines and fusion/updates of ethnic cuisines (second-generation immigrants
        tweaking their family tradition), plus all the fashionable spots, casual bistros, lounges for drinking and
        noshing and more.</p>

    <h3>Credit cards</h3>
    <p>While most restaurants accept credit cards, some smaller restaurants, particularly in Chinatown and
        Williamsburg, do not. Others have required minimum purchase amounts for credit/debit purchases. Most
        establishments will prominently display this requirement, so keep your eyes open if you typically pay for
        meals with plastic.</p>

    <h3>Tipping</h3>
    <p>As in the rest of the United States, tipping is expected in New York restaurants. New Yorkers often calculate
        the base tip by doubling the tax. For more information, see Tipping in the United States.</p>

    <h3>Dress Codes</h3>
    <p>Restaurants with meal courses under $20 are unlikely to have any preference about what their customers wear.
        Of course, like most major cities, New York has some expensive, extremely fashionable restaurants that care
        about, and enforce, a certain level of dress among their customers - but "jackets only" restaurants are very
        uncommon nowadays.</p>

    <p>If you're from elsewhere in the US and wish to "pass" as a local within Manhattan, pay attention to your
        shoes and coat.</p>

    <h2>Vegetarians</h2>
    <p>New York is a friendly place for vegetarians and vegans. There are many vegetarian only restaurants with
        offerings varying from macrobiotic food to Ayurvedic thalis or Asian Buddhist food. But, more importantly,
        almost every restaurant at every point on the price scale has vegetarian dishes that are more than an
        afterthought. Even Per Se, one of the most expensive and sought after restaurants in the city, has a seven
        course vegetarian tasting menu well worth the expense. DIY vegetarians will have no problem finding fresh
        vegetables, a wide variety of cheese, bread and prepared vegetarian foods in New York supermarkets.</p>

    <h2>Street Food</h2>
    <p>Nothing differentiates New York more from other American cities than the astonishing amount of food cooked
        and served on the streets. Starting with the thousands of hot dog stands on almost every street corner (try
        Hallo Berlin on 54th and Fifth for the best rated sausages), the possibilities are endless. People trek to
        Jackson Heights in Queens for a nibble of the famous arepas of the Arepa Lady. Freshly cooked Indian dosas
        are served up for a pittance at the NY Dosas stand in Washington Square Park. The Trinidadian/Pakistani
        Trinipak cart on 43rd and Sixth. Danny Meyer, the famous restaurateur, has a burger stand ("Shake Shack") in
        Madison Square Park as well as a new location on the upper west side. The halal offerings in midtown are
        legendary (Kwik-Meal on 45th and Sixth; Chicken Guy/Halal Chicken on 53rd and Sixth and many others). Most
        carts serve lunch (from about eleven in the morning to five or six in the evening) and disappear after dark,
        so look for a cart near you, smell what's cooking, and enjoy a hot and often tasty lunch for a few dollars
        (a meal costs anywhere from about $2-8). Mornings, from about 6AM-10AM, the streets are dotted with coffee
        carts that sell coffee, croissants, bagels, and danish pastries and are good for a cheap breakfast: small
        coffee and bagel for a dollar or so. From 10AM to 7PM many vendors sell lunch and dinner choices, including
        hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, and halal. Other street vendors sell italian ices, pretzels, ice cream, and
        roasted peanuts. Also, look around for the coffee truck (often found in Union Square), dessert truck, as
        well as Belgian waffle truck that roam around the city.</p>

    <h2>Do It Yourself</h2>
    <p>New York's many markets and grocery stores make preparing your own food interesting and easy. Almost every
        grocery store, deli, or bodega has a prepared foods section where you can make your own salad (beware, you
        are charged by the pound!) or buy ready to eat foods such as burritos, tacos, curries and rice, lasagna,
        pastas, pre-prepared or freshly-made sandwiches, and many other types of foods. Whole Foods has five New
        York City locations, all with a variety of foods, and a clean place to sit and eat but any supermarket will
        have enough to take away to the park or your hotel room for a low cost meal. If you have a place to cook,
        you'll find almost any kind of food in New York though you may have to travel to the outer boroughs for
        ethnic ingredients. Most supermarkets have Thai, Chinese, and Indian sauces to add flavor to your pot, and
        many, especially in upper Manhattan, have the ingredients necessary for a Mexican or Central American meal,
        but go to Chinatown for the best Chinese ingredients, Little India in Murray Hill for Indian ingredients,
        Flushing for all things Chinese or Korean, Jackson Heights for Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and Indian, Flatbush
        and Crown Heights for Jamaican, Williamsburg for Kosher, Greenpoint for Polish, or Brighton Beach for
        Russian & Eastern European. Ask around for where you can get your favorite ethnic ingredients and you'll
        find traveling around in local neighborhoods a rewarding experience. There is also a Trader Joe's at Union
        Square for cheap but delicious supermarket buys. Western Beef Supermarkets offer more foods from different
        ethnicities than average supermarkets.</p>
