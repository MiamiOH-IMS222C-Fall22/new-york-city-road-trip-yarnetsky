# Do

A general word of advice on sightseeing in New York:

Tourists often spend their entire vacation in New York standing in line (or as New Yorkers say, "standing on line").
This is often unnecessary; there are usually alternatives. For example, one can choose to avoid the Empire State
Building during the day (it is open, and empty, late, until midnight or 2AM on weekends during summer), skip the Statue
of Liberty in favor of the Staten Island Ferry, and stay away from the Guggenheim on Monday (it is one of the only
museums open that day). Also, there is no reason to stand in line for a Broadway show if you already have a ticket with
an assigned seat. If you prefer, get a drink nearby and come back closer to curtain time, when you can walk right in.
The lines for bus tours can be absurd because tourists all seem to have the exact same itinerary - which is get on a bus
in the morning in Times Square, get off for the Statue of Liberty, and finish on the East Side in the afternoon. Why not
go downtown in the morning, and save Midtown for the afternoon? You will thank yourself for avoiding the crowds. Also,
understand that buses are the slowest way to go crosstown in Midtown Manhattan during peak hours, and taxis are not much
better. You are often better off either on foot or taking the subway.

Two tips for smart tourists, who realize that subway and foot tours are the way to go:

First, before you even leave your hotel, download a Google Map of New York City, including subways. This will let you
keep track of your subway progress and make changes on the fly, even when you are without cell service on the subway.

Second, rather than sit on a bus going 3 MPH throughout New York City, take the subway to your preferred neighborhood
and take a walking tour. There are a plethora of walking tour companies that will get you to all the spots you want to
see within 2-3 hours. And since there are multiple walking tour companies, the prices are low! You shouldn't expect to
pay any more than $30 - $35 for a 2-3 hour tour.

## Entertainment

### Theater and Performing Arts

New York's Broadway is famous for its many shows, especially musicals. You might want to visit TKTS online, which offers
tickets for shows the same night at discounted prices, usually 50% off or visit BroadwayBox.com or NYTix.com, both
community sites posting all recent Broadway discounts. TKTS has two offices, one at Times Square with lines often hours
long, and a much faster one (sometimes minutes) at South Street Seaport (Corner of John St, just south of Brooklyn
Bridge). Only cash is accepted at South Street. Show up at opening time for best selection. Tickets to most Broadway
shows are also available from the Broadway Concierge and Ticket Center, inside the Times Square Visitor Center. They
offer restaurant and hotel recommendations, parking help, and other services in addition to ticket sales, available in
several languages.

New York boasts an enormous number and variety of theatrical performances. These shows usually fall into one of three
categories: Broadway, Off-Broadway, or Off-Off-Broadway. Broadway refers to the shows near Times Square that usually
play to theaters of 500 seats or more. These include the major musicals and big-name dramatic works, and are the most
popular with visitors. Tickets for Broadway shows can run to $130 a seat, though discounters like TKTS (above) make
cheaper seats available. Off-Broadway indicates performances that are smaller (less than 500 seats) and usually of a
certain intellectual seriousness. Some of these theaters are located around Times Square in addition to different
locations throughout Manhattan. Tickets to Off-Broadway shows tend to range from $25–50. Off-Off-Broadway refers to
those shows that play to very small audiences (less than 100 seats) with actors working without equity. These can be
dirt cheap and often very good, but some may be sufficiently avant-garde as to turn off conservative playgoers.
Off-Off-Broadway Theaters worth checking out are Rising Sun Performance Company, Endtimes Productions, and The People's
Improv Theater.

For current and upcoming Broadway and Off-Broadway info and listings, visit Playbill.com. This site also has lots of
articles on what's going on in the NY commercial theater scene. Broadway.com and Newyorkcitytheatre.com also has plenty
of info, as well as some videos and photos. Theatermania has many discounts to the bigger shows, and also provides
listings for the Off-Off scene. If visiting in the summer, brave the huge lines and attempt to get tickets to the Public
Theater annual "Shakespeare in the Park," which often features big-time stars of stage and screen. Meryl Streep, Kevin
Kline, Natalie Portman, and Liev Schrieber are just a few of the actors to have appeared here in recent years. Oh, and
it's free. Just get to one of the box offices ridiculously early, especially the one at the Park.

It's possible to purchase tickets to The Tony Awards, Broadway's biggest award ceremony and the culmination of the
theatrical season in the city. These aren't cheap, but if you're into the theater scene and know something about the
various performers being honored, it can be an exciting night. In any case, the performances are always fun, and you can
catch moments that aren't in the broadcast. Always the first or second Sunday night in June, visit The Tony Awards
website for the most current details.

New York has a wide variety of musical and dance companies, including several that are among the world's most renowned.
There are also numerous small companies putting on more idiosyncratic shows every night of the week. The following are
just a few of New York's most high-profile music and dance options.

* Brooklyn Academy of Music(BAM), 30 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn. Home to the impressive Brooklyn Philharmonic, BAM is one
of the best places in the country to attend cutting-edge new musical and dance performances. The Next Wave Festival
every autumn is a much-anticipated event of the New York performance scene.
* Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue. The premier venue for classical music in the United States, Carnegie Hall is famous
around the world for its dazzling performances. Playing at Carnegie Hall is, for many classical musicians, the epitome
of success. Carnegie Hall houses three different auditoriums, with the Isaac Stern auditorium being the largest venue.
* Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center, 155 W 65th St (at Broadway). The Chamber
Music Society is the most prestigious chamber music ensemble in the United States, playing in the acoustically
impeccable Alice Tully Hall.
* Metropolitan Opera at Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center, 155 W 65th St (at Broadway). The Met (as it is known)
is one of the greatest opera companies in the world. The company performs six days a week (Monday-Saturday) during the
season (Sep-Apr), and always lands the greatest singers from around the globe. Expect to pay a small fortune for the
most expensive seats, but upper-tier seats can cost as little as $25.
* New York City Ballet at New York State Theater in Lincoln Center, 155 W 65th St (at Broadway). Founded by George
Balanchine, the New York City Ballet is among the world's best dance companies. Their performances of the The
Nutcracker, during the holiday season, are enormously popular.
* New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center, 155 W 65th St (at Broadway). One of the premier orchestras
in the United States, playing a wide variety of concerts (more than 100) every year to sold-out crowds, the Philharmonic

in the summer they play free concerts in parks around the city.
* Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, +1-212-632-3975. See the Rockettes, another show or just tour the
famous Art Deco masterpiece.

### Film

New York is one of the world's greatest film cities, home to a huge number of theaters playing independent and repertory
programs. Many major US studio releases open earlier in New York than elsewhere (especially in the autumn) and can be
found at the major cineplexes (AMC, United Artists, etc.) around the city. As with everything else in New York, movies
are quite popular, and even relatively obscure films at unappealing times of the day can still be sold out. It's best to
get tickets in advance whenever possible.

As many films premiere in New York, you can often catch a moderated discussion with the director or cast after the show.
Sometimes even repertory films will have post-screening discussions or parties. Check listings for details.

In addition to the more than 15 commercial multiplexes located throughout the city, some of the more intriguing New York
film options include:

* Film Forum 209 W Houston St. A stylish theater in Greenwich Village that runs two programs—contemporary independent
releases and classic repertory films. While the current releases are almost always interesting and worth seeing, it's
the repertory programming schedule that filmlovers anticipate eagerly.
* American Museum of the Moving Image 35th Ave and 36th St, Queens. AMMI contains a museum devoted to, literally, moving
images, so visitors will find exhibits on zoetropes and video games in addition to film and television. It also puts on
a terrific screening program, with films showing continuously throughout the day.
* Angelika Film Center 18 W Houston St at Broadway, +1-212-995-2000. Just down the street from Film Forum, the Angelika
plays new independent and foreign films, many of which are only screened in New York. The cafe upstairs is something of
a hotspot as well.
* Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Ave (at E 2nd St). A varied program of unique films, both repertory and new, most
playing for only one or two screenings. Many of the films shown here can't be seen anywhere else (for better or worse).
It also plays host to several film festivals yearly. Subway: F to 2nd Avenue-Lower East Side
* Cinema Village On 22 E 12th St between University Place and Fifth Ave, +1-212-629-5097 Cinema Village specializes in
showing documentaries, independent and foreign films. Often the films there will not be playing anywhere else in the
country and Q&As with directors are common at opening weekends.
* Film Society at Lincoln Center Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, 155 W 65th St (at Broadway). The Film Society
always puts on a terrific repertory program and shows a wide variety of experimental and foreign films. In addition,
numerous talks and panels are held here, many featuring bold-named directors, screenwriters, and actors.
* MoMA 11 West 53rd Street. In addition to being the crown jewel of modern art museums, MoMA puts on a terrific repertory
program in a nicely renovated theater below the museum. And compared to other New York movie theaters, tickets to films
at MoMA are a steal.
* New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. Running in October, the New York Film Festival is one of the country's best,
with great films from around the world accompanied by interesting discussions, lectures, and panels. Be advised that
tickets usually sell out at least a month in advance.
* Tribeca Film Festival. Throughout May the movie theaters of Lower Manhattan are taken over by the Tribeca Film Festival,
which puts on a truly enormous amount of screenings and talks. Just a few years old, the Tribeca Film Festival has
already secured a prominent place in New York's film calendar.

## Parades

New York City hosts many parades, street festivals and outdoor pageants. These are some of the most famous:

* Saint Patrick's Day Parade. The largest St. Paddy's parade in the world! Route is up 5th Ave from 44th St to 86th St and
lasts from 11AM to about 2:30PM. Celebrations in pubs citywide happen the rest of the day and night until the green beer
runs out.
* Labor Day (also known as West Indian Day Parade or New York Caribbean Carnival). An annual celebration held in Crown
Heights, Brooklyn. Its main event is the West Indian-American Day Parade, which attracts between one and three million
spectators, thus taking in more foot traffic in one day than the entirety of Toronto's Caribana festival. The spectators
watch the parade on its route along Eastern Parkway. The large parade is held on American Labor Day, the first Monday in
September.
* New York's Village Halloween Parade. Each Halloween (31 Oct) at 7PM. This parade and street pageant attracts 2 million
spectators and 50,000 costumed participants along Sixth Ave between Spring St and 21st St. Anyone in a costume is
welcome to march; those wishing to, should show up 6PM-9PM at Spring St and 6th Ave.
* Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The morning of each Thanksgiving on Central Park W, this parade attracts many spectators
and is broadcast on nationwide television.
